# Contributing to InstantX

[Instant eXchange] community shares the spirit of the [Apache Way](https://apache.org/theapacheway/) and believes in "Community over Code". We welcome any and all types of contributions that benefit the community at large, not just code contributions:

* Providing user feedback
* Share your use cases
* Collaborate with related products and technologies
* Maintaining our wiki and improving documentation
* Contribute test scenarios and test code
* Fix bugs and add new features

## Providing feedback via GitHub issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed report when you
encounter an issue.

Check that [our issue database] doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, you can use the "subscribe" button to get notified on
updates. Do *not* leave random "+1" or "I have this too" comments, as they
only clutter the discussion, and don't help resolving it. However, if you
have ways to reproduce the issue or have additional information that may help
resolving the issue, please leave a comment.

Also include the steps required to reproduce the problem if possible and
applicable. This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.
When sending lengthy log-files, consider posting them as a [gist](https://gist.github.com).
Don't forget to remove sensitive data from your logfiles before posting (you can replace those parts with "REDACTED").
